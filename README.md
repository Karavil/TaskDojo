Taskdōjō takes your traditional to-do list app and builds open it. It not only allows you to write your to-do, work, grocery, trip, and household lists but also filter tasks, set up recurring events, collaborate with others, and much more.

No matter how much is on your plate, taskdōjō makes it super easy to remember all the little things in your life and keeps you on track.

This app was built with React connected to a PostgreSQL back-end server (hosted on Heroku).
